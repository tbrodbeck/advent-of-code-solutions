# Advent of Code 2025 - AI Assistant Instructions

## When user says "go" in a day directory

1. **Determine the day number** from the current directory (e.g., `day07/` → day 7)

2. **Read the problem description**:
   - Use web_search with the EXACT URL as search term: `https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/{day_number}`
   - Do NOT use `site:` prefix or add keywords - just the plain URL
   - Understand Part 1 requirements (Part 2 comes after solving Part 1)

3. **Get the input data**:
   - FIRST check if `input.txt` already has content (read it before asking user)
   - If empty, ask user to paste input
   - Do both steps 2 and 3 in parallel

4. **Implement the solution**:
   - Always deduplicate code - never repeat logic
   - Parse once when both parts use same data
   - Docstrings: one-line description + Args/Returns on single lines

5. **Create tests**:
   - Update `test_solve.py` with example from problem description
   - Test both parts with the provided examples

6. **Verify**:
   - Run `python solve.py` to get answers
   - Run `python -m day{day_number}.test_solve` to verify tests pass

## File Structure

- `dayXX/solve.py` - Main solution file
- `dayXX/test_solve.py` - Test file
- `dayXX/input.txt` - Puzzle input
- `dayXX/__init__.py` - Package init file
